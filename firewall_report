# Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Firewall**: Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- **Command Line Tool**: `ping`

---

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed

### 1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- Press `Win + R`, type `wf.msc`, and press Enter.

### 2. Create a New Inbound Rule to Block ICMP (Ping)
1. Go to **Inbound Rules** â†’ **New Rule**.
2. Select **Custom Rule**.
3. Protocol type: **ICMPv4**.
4. Scope: All IP addresses.
5. Action: **Block the connection**.
6. Profile: Select all (Domain, Private, Public).
7. Name: `Block_ICMP_Echo`.

### 3. Test the Rule from Another PC
- **Before Blocking**: From friendâ€™s PC, ping my IP â€” replies received.
- **After Blocking**: From friendâ€™s PC, ping my IP â€” request timed out.

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

| Test Case                  | Expected Result        | Actual Result        |
|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Ping before blocking rule  | Reply received         | âœ… Success            |
| Ping after blocking rule   | Request timed out      | âœ… Success            |

##âœ…Remove the Test Block Rule (Windows)
In Inbound Rules, right-click Block_ICMP_Echo â†’ Delete.

##âœ…Summary â€” How a Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Inbound Rules: Control what traffic can enter the system.
Example: Blocking ICMP inbound prevents others from pinging your system.

Outbound Rules: Control what traffic can leave the system.
Example: Blocking outbound ICMP prevents you from pinging others.

Filtering Criteria can include:

Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Port number

Source/Destination IP

Network profile (Domain, Private, Public)

In this task, blocking ICMP Echo Requests at the firewall level prevented any ping replies from being sent, effectively making the host invisible to basic ping probes.

##âœ… Conclusion
The firewall was successfully configured to block inbound ICMP traffic. Testing confirmed that pings from another device on the same network resulted in timeouts, proving that the rule was applied correctly.

This exercise demonstrates:

How to create and test firewall rules.

How inbound filtering can be used to protect a system from specific types of network traffic.

The role of a firewall as a first line of defense in network security.
